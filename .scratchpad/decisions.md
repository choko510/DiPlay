# Decisions

## Keep Wi-Fi Direct cleanup strict when system credentials are incomplete

If `createGroup(null)` succeeds but Android omits the system-generated passphrase, the group identity is incomplete. Fail startup without retrying rejected custom credentials or removing a group that cannot be proven to be owned by this attempt.

## Keep connection traces opt-in and app-owned

The debug setting applies from the next connection attempt and writes structured elapsed-time events to bounded app storage. This keeps tracing independent of the foreground activity lifecycle; existing session logs continue to supply throughput and media diagnostics in the same exported report.

## Keep one USBMUX IN request and use bounded recovery

USBMUX now reuses one 32 KiB direct-buffer request across wait timeouts; framing rebuilds up to 64 KiB messages above the USB read layer. On failure, close the wired CSM, USBMUX/session, and VPN/NCM together, then allow three bounded clean retries at 400, 800, and 1,200 ms before surfacing a deep-recovery candidate. USBMUX and NCM remain on separate `UsbDeviceConnection`s because the current interface layout provides no evidence that combining them improves reliability.

## Bind asynchronous startup results to the wired attempt

AirPlay startup success and VPN/NCM transport errors must identify the attachment/connection attempt that produced them before they can cancel a watchdog or tear down/restart the wired stack. Allocate that attempt ID when `openDataPaths()` begins so iAP2 USB session and NCM open failures share the wired retry budget. A service-local cleanup is not sufficient when the controller still owns the iAP2 CSM and USBMUX host.

The attempt check must be atomic with the state mutation or cleanup it protects. A check followed by an unscoped callback or teardown still leaves a check-then-act race.

For the user-visible wired startup interval, keep the watchdog active until the screen stream is opened. The AirPlay `RECORD` event marks its control session active earlier, while the host still shows its Opening panel.

## Keep extra USB diagnostics opt-in and bounded

Use the existing debug-log preference for syslog relay capture and small CarKit write splitting. Limit the capture by time, bytes, and matching-line count, and log only process-category counts so raw phone log contents are not persisted.

## Preserve observed USBMUX receive compatibility

Keep the received TCP `word8` field diagnostic-only because observed iPhone replies omit the host's `0xfeedface` value. The version handshake still validates its response version; do not reject TCP frames on an unconfirmed magic-field rule.

## Keep NCM bulk-IN requests persistent and status polling off

Treat `requestWait` timeout as idle while preserving the queued request; treat a null result, queue failure, or unexpected completion as a terminal NCM transport error. Close the full bridge on terminal errors. Do not run synchronous status-endpoint transfers on the shared connection by default; retain an explicit diagnostic switch for A/B testing.

## Retry only idempotent NDP during NCM startup

Report OUT not-ready results instead of dropping them silently. Before link readiness is proven, use one short OUT timeout for all frames and retry only Neighbor Solicitation/Advertisement frames after CarPlayStartSession, with five short bounded attempts; leave TCP/UDP retransmission to their own protocols.

## Use evidence for NCM link readiness

Track `PRE_CARPLAY_START`, `CARPLAY_START_SENT`, `NCM_LINK_PROBING`, and `NCM_LINK_READY`. Require both inbound IPv6 and a successful outbound IPv6 write before inferring bidirectional readiness; accepted AirPlay control traffic remains an independent strong readiness signal.

## Pair NCM interfaces from CDC Union descriptors

Use each Union descriptor's master/slave interface IDs to pair control and data interfaces. Permit a no-Union fallback only when one control interface and one usable bulk data interface exist. Record all candidates and descriptor evidence; choose the first descriptor-ordered candidate only when the highest evidence is tied.

## Keep Apple USB mode recovery diagnostic-only

Query/guess the current Apple mode and configuration set for diagnostics, but do not toggle modes automatically. The current evidence does not show that repeated mode switches are safe without a USB reset, and Android USB Host does not expose a public device reset primitive.

## Fence and serialize wired teardown

Capture and clear an attempt's resources under the attempt lock, then close them outside it. A separate close mutex serializes concurrent teardown callers without holding the attempt lock across service/session callbacks.

Fence asynchronous USB data-path opens with a generation token and recheck it before publishing the session or NCM bridge. A stale callback closes its own resources and cannot affect the replacement attempt.

## Route CarPlay OEM host UI requests from the common host layer

`CarPlayController` forwards `onHostUiRequested` through its UI listener without selecting an Android Activity. `CarPlayHostActivity` opens `DiPlayMenuActivity` so `shared` does not depend on `common`; the existing `CarPlayBackgroundSession` remains responsible for retaining the controller and media sink while the host UI is covered.

## Scope menu return behavior to the settings root

Treat a menu-origin `DiPlayActivity` as the settings subtree: Back from About returns to Settings, and only Back from the Settings root finishes the Activity to reveal the Menu. When a reconnect starts a new CarPlay host, finish the menu-origin Settings Activity only after the host launch succeeds so repeated setting changes do not accumulate Settings instances.

## Separate navigation output offers from voice and media

Restrict the high-rate-only negotiation fix to stream type 101 (AltAudio). Wired type 101/default and compatibility advertise configured 44.1/48 kHz PCM; wireless type 101/default also advertises Opus, while compatibility stays PCM-only. Keep type 100 MainAudio PCM capabilities broad, and make its Opus and microphone input offers transport-specific. Keep type 102 media unchanged.

Keep the transport flag false by default and set it only when creating the wireless AirPlay session config. This preserves wired callers while making /info capabilities match the active transport.

## Remove BYD outputs without changing RouteGuidance negotiation

Delete the BYD output consumers and their `onIncoming` controller callbacks while retaining the generic iAP2 RouteGuidance advertisement, subscription messages, endpoint registry, and subscription test. The capability is part of protocol negotiation independently of the removed HUD output.

## Bind persistent YouTube storage to a verified iPhone identity

Resolve identity in this order: Pair Verify controller ID, AirPlay device ID, then Wi-Fi MAC. Hash a versioned, source-prefixed key before using it as GeckoView's context ID. Do not store the raw identifier or Google credentials; GeckoView owns the persistent cookie and web storage for each context.

Keep one application-scoped GeckoRuntime and create/close Activity-scoped GeckoSessions per device context. Closing a session must never clear its storage context, so returning to the same iPhone restores its Google login.

## Split CarPlay and YouTube inside the existing host

Keep CarPlayController, AndroidMediaSink, and CarPlayBackgroundSession in CarPlayHostActivity. Put the CarPlay TextureView, touch layer, and connection panel in the same left pane; let GeckoView own the right pane. Defer CarPlay restarts until the latest pane size has settled, and use ABI-specific APKs to preserve all supported architectures without shipping every GeckoView native library to every device.

## Keep restart ownership pending until a new controller is stored

A resize restart remains claimable across Activity destruction until the replacement CarPlay controller is stored. A claimed but not-yet-started Activity releases the claim on destruction; an ownerless handoff can be cancelled by Disconnect and suppresses automatic startup until a fresh host launch. Transfer the stop callback when a new host claims ownership so Disconnect never targets a destroyed Activity.

## Bound Google popups to one same-context GeckoSession

HTTPS new-window requests and `about:blank` can create one temporary GeckoSession using the same iPhone context ID. Return to the primary session on popup close; deny HTTP and external schemes, do not log or persist popup URLs, and restore the primary session's most recent load state.
