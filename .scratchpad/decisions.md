# Decisions

## Keep connection traces opt-in and app-owned

The debug setting applies from the next connection attempt and writes structured elapsed-time events to bounded app storage. This keeps tracing independent of the foreground activity lifecycle; existing session logs continue to supply throughput and media diagnostics in the same exported report.

## Keep one USBMUX IN request and use bounded recovery

USBMUX now reuses one 32 KiB direct-buffer request across wait timeouts; framing rebuilds up to 64 KiB messages above the USB read layer. On failure, close the wired CSM, USBMUX/session, and VPN/NCM together, then allow at most one automatic retry. USBMUX and NCM remain on separate `UsbDeviceConnection`s because the current interface layout provides no evidence that combining them improves reliability.

## Bind asynchronous startup results to the wired attempt

AirPlay startup success and VPN/NCM transport errors must identify the attachment/connection attempt that produced them before they can cancel a watchdog or tear down/restart the wired stack. A service-local cleanup is not sufficient when the controller still owns the iAP2 CSM and USBMUX host.

The attempt check must be atomic with the state mutation or cleanup it protects. A check followed by an unscoped callback or teardown still leaves a check-then-act race.

For the user-visible wired startup interval, keep the watchdog active until the screen stream is opened. The AirPlay `RECORD` event marks its control session active earlier, while the host still shows its Opening panel.

## Keep extra USB diagnostics opt-in and bounded

Use the existing debug-log preference for syslog relay capture and small CarKit write splitting. Limit the capture by time, bytes, and matching-line count, and log only process-category counts so raw phone log contents are not persisted.

## Preserve observed USBMUX receive compatibility

Keep the received TCP `word8` field diagnostic-only because observed iPhone replies omit the host's `0xfeedface` value. The version handshake still validates its response version; do not reject TCP frames on an unconfirmed magic-field rule.

## Route CarPlay OEM host UI requests from the common host layer

`CarPlayController` forwards `onHostUiRequested` through its UI listener without selecting an Android Activity. `CarPlayHostActivity` opens `DiPlayMenuActivity` so `shared` does not depend on `common`; the existing `CarPlayBackgroundSession` remains responsible for retaining the controller and media sink while the host UI is covered.
